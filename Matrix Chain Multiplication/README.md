Matrix Chain multiplication Problem using Dynamic Programming.<br>

<b>Input</b> : The code will take n numbers of dimensions of matrices as input.<br>
For example, n = { 10, 20, 5, 40, 7, 60, 15, 35 }<br>

<b>Output</b> : Print the <b>m[i,j]</b> & <b>s[i,j]</b> matrix and print the proper ,<br>
parenthesization of matrices by numbering them as Ai where i ranges in  0  to n-1
